#  Scholarship Management System

## Introduction

We are building an **open-source scholarship management platform** designed for NGOs, educational trusts, and organizations that provide scholarships. Currently, many of these groups handle applications manually, which is **time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient**.

This project automates the entire workflow — from application submission to review, approval, and fund disbursement — saving time and reducing manual effort.

## Scope

* **Deployment**:

  * Easy to self-host with minimal technical knowledge.
  * Once set up, the system runs independently with low maintenance.

* **Integration**:

  * Organizations can **redirect applicants from their own website** directly into the system.
  * All scholarship workflows are handled here.

* **Features**:

  * **Admin Dashboard** → manage scholarships, applications, and reporting.
  * **Student Portal** → apply, track status, receive notifications.
  * **Automation** → reduces paperwork and manual data entry.
  * **Scalability** → supports multiple NGOs/organizations.

* **Vision**:

  * Provide a **reliable, open-source tool** for scholarship providers.
  * Act as an **independent entity** that organizations can adopt without needing to build their own system.

# ðŸ“„ Internal Documentation: Database Architecture & Migration Plan

## 1. Background

When we first launched, we selected **Vercel Postgres** as our database because:

- It was seamlessly integrated with Vercel hosting  
- Minimal setup was required, letting us iterate quickly  
- Early stage â†’ cost & performance were not major concerns  

To interact with the database, we initially explored **Prisma** but found:

- Prisma was heavyweight, with large client size and slower cold starts  
- Limited flexibility when self-hosting on VPS in the future  

Instead, we adopted **Drizzle ORM**, because:

- Lightweight and TypeScript-first  
- Schema defined in code, enabling better version control  
- Easy to adapt for Postgres, MySQL, or SQLite  
- Excellent for monolithic architecture with plans to scale

## 2. Hosting Strategy

- **Short term**: continue using Vercel Postgres for staging/dev  
- **Long term**: move to self-hosted Postgres on VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.)  

### Benefits
- Full control over performance tuning  
- Cost efficiency at scale  
- Can integrate read replicas, caching, and partitioning later

## 3. Migration Plan

1. Define new schema in Drizzle (normalized tables)  
2. Export old data â†’ transform â†’ load into new schema  
3. Write migration script (ETL style) with validation checks  
4. Update app code to query via Drizzle models  
5. Test on staging before switching production traffic
